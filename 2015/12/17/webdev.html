Mockup courtesy of http://www.graphberry.com/"></p><p>This year I spent considerable time getting familiar with the recent trends in web development. I was motivated to learn web development because, a web-app is very easily accessible to a wide range of audience. So your ideas when presented on the web can reach more people compared to e.g. through a Matlab based demo. Based on my experience, here are four tips that can make learning web development easier.<!--more--></p><p>In the past I had done some basic web development. This year my goal was to learn something beyond basic HTML, CSS and Javascript. I wanted to find out -</p><ol><li>Which frameworks and utilities can enable me to quickly design an app?</li><li>What are the best practices in modern web development?</li><li>What are some creative examples of web technology use in education?</li></ol><p>The four points described below helped me stay motivated in re-learning web development.</p><h2 id=follow-the-work-of-good-developers-and-projects>Follow the work of good developers and projects</h2><p>At the beginning of this year, I started following some key names in web development on Twitter and other platforms - <a href=https://twitter.com/addyosmani>Addy Osmani</a>, <a href=https://twitter.com/googledevs>Google Developers</a>, <a href=https://twitter.com/ChromiumDev>Chrome Developers</a>. I added a bunch of design, web development related sites to my news reader - <a href="http://tympanus.net/codrops/">codrops</a>, <a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/">Smashing Magazine</a>, <a href="http://www.webdesignerdepot.com/">Webdesigner Depot</a> and my favourite <a href="http://alistapart.com/">A List Apart</a>. This helped tremendously. I could stay updated with the new tools coming out every day and I also got a sense of the current trends in web development. Once I had an idea of the cool new things in the field, I started trying out various frameworks.</p><h2 id=dont-write-code-implement-ideas>Don’t write code, implement ideas</h2><p>As I was learning more about the tools, I started working on smaller projects that implemented ideas. This kept me motivated to learn more. The first project I started working on was a redesign of my personal website. I figured, a website with a blog would be appropriate since I wanted to showcase my work as well as my hobbies. With that, I chose <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> as the base. Jekyll let’s you create static websites with ease. That way you do not have to worry about setting up a <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_management_system>content management system</a>. I chose <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a> as the framework to style my site and <a href="https://jquery.com/">jQuery</a> as a helper library. I setup a build workflow using <a href="http://yeoman.io/">Yeoman</a> and <a href="http://gruntjs.com/">Grunt</a>. Figure below shows the general structure of my website.</p><p><a href="http://www.harshadparanjape.com/"><img src=https://www.harshadparanjape.com/img/hp-blog-webdev-hp.png alt="Structure of harshadparanjape.com" title="Structure of my personal website" class="hp-blog-post-img-med"></a></p><p>Over the course of this year, I designed three more apps. One was a <a href="http://beamteam.co/">website for the research group</a> I work at. I wanted to create an informal academic site to showcase what the group does. So I chose to develop a single page site. I was really impressed by some websites I came across that used a video background on the landing page. So I designed a short animation using <a href="https://www.blender.org/">Blender</a>. That got me some good experience with 3D modeling as well.</p><p><a href="http://beamteam.co/"><img src=https://www.harshadparanjape.com/img/hp-blog-webdev-bt.png alt="Structure of beamteam.co" title="Structure of the Beam Team website" class="hp-blog-post-img-med"></a></p><p>One project that really gave me the full-stack development experience was an app to visualize beer characteristics - <a href="http://www.brewpf.harshadparanjape.com/">brewPF</a>. This app uses <a href=http://www.ebsd.com/popup/inversepolefigure.htm>inverse pole figures</a> from crystallography to visualize beers on the basis of their alcohol content, taste and color. For this, I obtained <a href="http://www.brewerydb.com/">data</a> by consuming a RESTful web service in MATLAB. Processed the data in MATLAB. Setup a Python, <a href="http://flask.pocoo.org/">Flask</a>, <a href="https://wsgi.readthedocs.org/en/latest/">wsgi</a> backend that communicated with the frontend using REST. Developed a frontend with <a href="https://angularjs.org/">AngularJS</a>. And used JSON, SVG etc along the way. So essentially those three weekends taught me pretty much every buzz word in web development.</p><p><a href="http://www.brewpf.harshadparanjape.com/"><img src=https://www.harshadparanjape.com/img/hp-blog-webdev-bpf.png alt="Structure of brewpf.harshadparanjape.com" title="Structure of BrewPF website" class="hp-blog-post-img-med"></a></p><p>The fourth project was really simple. A minimal <a href="http://www.onetwothree.harshadparanjape.com/">app to promote responsible drinking</a> based on a modification of the <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/0-0-1-3>0-0-1-3 approach</a>. My goal behind developing that app was to learn <a href="http://ionicframework.com/">Ionic</a> and <a href="https://cordova.apache.org/">Cardova</a>. But so far that has not happened.</p><p><a href="http://www.onetwothree.harshadparanjape.com/"><img src=https://www.harshadparanjape.com/img/hp-blog-webdev-ott.png alt="Structure of onetwothree.harshadparanjape.com" title="Structure of the onetwothree app" class="hp-blog-post-img-med"></a></p><h2 id=develop-a-theme-for-your-projects>Develop a theme for your projects</h2><p>Developing a theme for each project really helped in learning about User Experience aspect of each app. Developing a theme involved choosing a <a href=https://color.adobe.com>color palette</a>, overall look-and-feel, typography and elements like icons. For this I followed several blogs that showcase designs from artists every day - <a href="https://www.behance.net/">Behance</a>, <a href="http://abduzeedo.com/">Abduzeedo</a> to name a few. I got a fair amount of experience with design softwares like Inkscape and Illustrator as well.</p><p>I took this idea a little further for our research group website and <a href=http://hmparanjape.tumblr.com/post/117603417995/branding-for-our-research-group-the-beam-team>developed a brand identity</a> for the group.</p><h2 id=share-your-projects-and-get-feedback-often>Share your projects and get feedback often</h2><p>Finally, I was able to tweak the web-apps based on feedback and make them more useful. Additionally through the feedback, I got introduced to some great new tools and ideas.</p><p>For the next year, my goal is to design a couple of materials science demos using these techniques.</p></div></div><div class=row><div class="col-md-10 hp-blog-post-tail"><div class=hp-blog-subtitle><ul class="list-inline hp-blog-subtitle-item"><li class=hp-blog-category>design</li><li class=hp-blog-category>web-dev</li></ul><div class="hp-blog-share-buttons pull-right hp-blog-subtitle-item"><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=I Got Familiar with Modern Web development and Designed Four Web-apps Along the Way&url=https://www.harshadparanjape.com/2015/12/17/webdev.html&via=&related=" rel=nofollow target=_blank title="Share on Twitter">Twitter</a> <a href="https://facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https://www.harshadparanjape.com/2015/12/17/webdev.html" rel=nofollow target=_blank title="Share on Facebook">Facebook</a> <a href="mailto:?Subject=Interesting blog article&amp;Body=I%20saw%20this%20and%20thought%20you%20would%20like%20it!%20 - https://www.harshadparanjape.com/2015/12/17/webdev.html">Email</a></div></div></div></div><div class="row hp-blog-tail-helper-row"><div class="col-md-5 col-xs-6"><a href=../../../blog.html class=hp-blog-tail-helper>Return to blog</a></div><div class="col-md-5 col-xs-6 text-right"><a href=#hp-blog-empty-top class="hp-blog-scrollup hp-blog-tail-helper">Back to top</a></div></div><!-- Footer --><div class="row hp-footer"><div class=col-xs-12><p class="text-center hp-footer-content">&copy; 2022, Harshad Paranjape</p></div></div></div><!-- /.container --><script src=../../../js/script.js></script></body></html>
